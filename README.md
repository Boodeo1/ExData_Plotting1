# ExData_Plotting1
Plotting Assignment 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis

## This repo contains the plot.png in 480 * 480 pixels for the 4 plots required for this course and their plot.R files.

###The original data was forked from the course intructor R.D. Peng and a local repo created using git bash.

###After generating the plots, all were included in the folder together with the respective R scripts.

###These were added to the local git repo before being committed for pushing to the remote web url.

###The push to the web repo was not possible using "git push origin master" and therefore "git push -f origin master" was used instead, rather than the much easier "upload" option. 

###The plot4.png has been compressed to 480 * 480 which has altered its scale slightly, while the original graphics were at a higher scale of 505*505.
